**Pros of Krita**

1. Excellent for Digital Painting & Illustration  
- Krita's brush engine is extremely powerful and customizable with 100+ pre-installed brushes.  
- Real-time brush preview and stabilization for smooth strokes.

2. Free & Open Source  
- Fully free to use with no licensing costs—ideal for students, hobbyists, or professionals on a budget.  
- Open source means an active community and extensibility via scripts/plugins.

3. Intuitive, Artist-Centric UI  
- A UI designed specifically for illustrators and comic artists (less cluttered than Photoshop or GIMP).  
- Customizable workspace, themes, and dockers for tailored workflows.

4. Advanced Features at No Cost  
- Non-destructive layers, masks, filters, vector support, animation timeline, and more.  
- Supports HDR painting, perspective grids, and wrap-around mode (useful for game textures).

5. Frame-by-Frame Animation Tools  
- Krita supports 2D hand-drawn animation with a timeline, onion skinning, and audio sync.  
- Export to GIF, MP4 (with FFmpeg), or frame sequences.

6. Strong Color Management  
- Supports ICC profiles and soft-proofing—suitable for print professionals.  
- Gamut masks, CMYK support, and LUT preview.

7. Cross-Platform  
- Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android (tablet-optimized).

8. Python Scripting & Plugins  
- Automate tasks or extend functionality using Python.  
- The Plugin ecosystem is growing (palette generator, symmetry assistant, etc.).

**Cons of Krita**

1. Performance Limitations  
- Memory-hungry with large canvases or high-res animations.  
- May lag or crash on low-end systems (especially with many layers or brushes).

2. Animation Features Are Basic  
- While animation is supported, it's still limited compared to Toon Boom or OpenToonz.  
- No vector animation or automatic tweening.

3. Lacks Full Photo Editing Tools  
- Krita isn’t meant to replace Photoshop for photo editing.  
- No advanced image manipulation (like content-aware fill or healing brushes).

4. Documentation Can Be Dense  
- Though well-written, some sections of the official documentation are text-heavy or outdated.  
- The learning curve exists for new users without prior experience in digital art.

5. Limited File Format Support  
- While PSD is supported, compatibility isn’t perfect (layer effects may not transfer cleanly).  
- Less support for industry-standard formats used in VFX pipelines.
